## Steps

### **Phase 1 – Design and documentation of the contribution processes**

- **1.1** Diagram the lifecycle of a challenge and its contributions
- **1.2** Diagram the contribution processes
- **1.3** Write a contribution guide for code (branch usage, commit naming, etc.)

### **Phase 2 – Merge management**

- **2.1** Implement retrieval of previous contributions for the challenge
- **2.2** Implement the merge logic (users, roadmap steps, title and description)
- **2.3** Implement the merge agent (instructions, fine-tuning)

### **Phase 3 – Evaluation management**

- **3.1** Add support for “follow-up evaluations” (instructions and new contextual parameters) in the evaluation agent
- **3.2** Update the previous contribution with the new evaluation

### **Phase 4 – Trigger management**

- **4.1** Improve trigger management in the admin interface: launch a manual trigger and enable/disable automatic triggers (webhooks)
- **4.2** Implement a new GitHub automatic trigger fired by PRs on a challenge branch
